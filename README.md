# DVD Screensaver NX    

Classic DVD screensaver for Nintendo Switch made in Lua to demonstrate using [LÖVE](https://github.com/love2d/love) and [LÖVE Potion](https://github.com/lovebrew/lovepotion) for switch homebrew

# Build Requirements

To build, you'll need DevkitPro, LoveBrew, and LovePotion. Once you've installed all 3, simply run 'lovebrew build' in the directory.

# Known issues

- Screen boundaries are messed up when in docked mode

- App will not launch when run through Applet Mode (through the captures applet). Running it through title takeover will work fine however.

- Sometimes crashes upon exiting. I have no clue why this happens but i think its a LovePotion problem
